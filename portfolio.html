	<p style="color:MidnightBlue;"> In this project me and my partner made a game called Circle Vs. Square. In this game we made two turtles to start as the playable character and the boss. <br>
The game started with asking the user what class they would like to be. Then depending on their choice they were given three attacks to choose from. Each attack had their own accuracy. Using randomizers <br>
we randomized damage and accuracy between two numbers. This way the move did random damage and had a chance of missing. After this we coded fun moves for each attack in each class. We made turtles for <br>
for some moves to make them cooloer. Such as a fireball and ice spike. After this we coded the square to attack the circle. We made custom attacks and random damage for it too. We then made a you lose <br>
statement and a you win statement. Then lastly we looped all of the code so that as long as they are both alive the code will repeat and give the user multiple turns. This is the circle vs square game. <br />

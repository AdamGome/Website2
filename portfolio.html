	<p style="color:MidnightBlue;"> In this project me and my partner made a game called Circle Vs. Square. In this game we made two turtles to start as the playable character and the boss. <br>
The game started with asking the user what class they would like to be. Then depending on their choice they were given three attacks to choose from. Each attack had their own accuracy. Using randomizers <br>
we randomized damage and accuracy between two numbers. This way the move did random damage and had a chance of missing. After this we coded fun moves for each attack in each class. We made turtles for <br>
for some moves to make them cooloer. Such as a fireball and ice spike. After this we coded the square to attack the circle. We made custom attacks and random damage for it too. We then made a you lose <br>
statement and a you win statement. Then lastly we looped all of the code so that as long as they are both alive the code will repeat and give the user multiple turns. This is the circle vs square game. <br />

    	<p style="color:MidnightBlue;"> In this project we made a Halloween themed game. The goal of the game is to get as many candies as you can into the halloween basket. The candy goes <br>
left to right at the top of the screen. It  move quickly to add difficulty to the game. When the user clicks the screen the candy falls, if the user lands the candy into the basket they get a point. <br>
When the user does not land a candy into the basket the game ends and there is a game over message. In this project we used a list with diffrent turtle shapes and made the candy variable chose a random choice. <br>
This made the candy random everytime the candy was drawn. We used code that checked if there was a collision everytime the screen was clicked. If there was no collision then the user lost. This is the candy catch game. <br />

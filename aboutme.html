<h1 style="color:RoyalBlue;">Hello my Name is Adam </h1>
    <p style="color:RoyalBlue;">Hello my name is Adam Gomez. I am a sophmore here at RBHS. My favorite subjects are anything with tech because I enjoy the freedom we have in those classes. <br />
I was born in Florida and lived there for the first years of my life. From there I moved to Mobile, Al. I then lived there until the age of 7 where I moved to San Diego.

 <p style="color:RoyalBlue;">I enjoy cooking a lot. I love to cooks many diffrent things. For example, I enjoy cooking things like steaks and the sides that go with them. <br />
I really enjoy hanging out with friends. Such as going to the mall or beach to hang out. In addition, I also go to the gym. I started going with my friend a few months ago. <br />

<h1 style="color:RoyalBlue;">Family!</h1>
    <p style="color:RoyalBlue;">I have a twin brother. His name is Andrew Gomez. He also goes to RBHS. In addition, my family is pretty spread out. My cousins live in <br />
Birmingham Alabama. I recently went up there to see them during summer because it was my Aunt's 50th. There we had a huge party in their new new house. It was like a huge <br />
family reunion and I got to see many of my aunts and uncles. Overall it was a lot of fun and I hope to get a chance to see them again. <br />
